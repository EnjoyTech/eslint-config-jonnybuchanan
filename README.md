[![npm package][npm-badge]][npm]

A personal ESLint config, but with ESLint itself and all the necessary shareable config, plugins and parser as dependencies.

Provides a `lint` command which runs ESLint with this module's `.eslintrc` in the context of this module's dependencies, so I don't have to manage these dependencies in every project.
